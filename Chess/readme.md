## 🎯 Features

### ✅ Complete Chess Implementation
- **All 6 piece types** with authentic movement patterns
- **Turn-based gameplay** with player switching
- **King capture win conditions** 
- **Check detection system**
- **Board validation** and move legality checking
- **Letter-based piece symbols** for universal terminal compatibility

### 🧩 Piece Movement
- **K/k (King)** - One square in any direction
- **Q/q (Queen)** - Unlimited diagonal, horizontal, vertical
- **R/r (Rook)** - Unlimited horizontal and vertical  
- **B/b (Bishop)** - Unlimited diagonal movement
- **N/n (Knight)** - L-shaped moves (2+1 squares)
- **P/p (Pawn)** - Forward movement, diagonal capture, double-move from start

### 🎮 Game Features
- **Interactive command-line interface**
- **Letter-coded pieces** (White: UPPERCASE | Black: lowercase)
  - White pieces: `K Q R B N P`
  - Black pieces: `k q r b n p`
- **Move validation** prevents illegal moves
- **Check detection** warns when kings are threatened
- **Win conditions** trigger when king is captured
- **Clear board display** with coordinate system

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.0+ installed
- Terminal/Command line access

### Installation & Play
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wikkrau/Odin_Project/tree/master/Chess
cd Chess

# Run the game
ruby main.rb
```

### How to Play
1. **Game starts** with White player's turn
2. **Enter moves** in format: `e2 e4` (from-square to-square)
3. **Coordinates**: Columns a-h, Rows 1-8 (e.g., `a1`, `e4`, `h8`)
4. **Win condition**: Capture the opponent's king
5. **Type `quit`** to exit game

### Example Gameplay
```
r n b q k b n r
p p p p p p p p
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . P . . .
. . . . . . . .
P P P P . P P P
R N B Q K B N R

Player 1 (white), enter your move: e2 e4
```

### Piece Legend
```
White Pieces (UPPERCASE):
K = King    Q = Queen   R = Rook
B = Bishop  N = Knight  P = Pawn

Black Pieces (lowercase):
k = king    q = queen   r = rook
b = bishop  n = knight  p = pawn
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```

### Design Patterns
- **Object-Oriented Design** - Each piece is a class with specific behavior
- **Module Pattern** - Shared functionality via mixins
- **Strategy Pattern** - Different movement algorithms per piece type
- **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one clear purpose

## 🧪 Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **63 RSpec tests** covering all functionality
- **97% test coverage** of implemented features
- **Unit tests** for individual pieces
- **Integration tests** for game flow
- **Edge case testing** for move validation

### Run Tests
```bash
cd spec
rspec --pattern "*_spec.rb"
```

### Test Categories
- ✅ **Piece Movement Tests** - All 6 piece types
- ✅ **Board Management Tests** - Placement, validation
- ✅ **Game Logic Tests** - Turn switching, win conditions
- ✅ **Check System Tests** - King threat detection
- ⏸️ **Advanced Features** - Checkmate/Stalemate (pending)

## 🎯 Game Rules Implemented

### Standard Chess Rules
- ✅ **Piece movement** follows official chess rules
- ✅ **Turn alternation** between white and black
- ✅ **Capture mechanics** - pieces remove opponents
- ✅ **Check detection** - warns when king threatened
- ✅ **Win by capture** - game ends when king taken
- ⏸️ **Checkmate/Stalemate** - marked for future implementation

### Movement Validation
- **Collision detection** - pieces can't jump over others (except knights)
- **Friendly fire prevention** - can't capture own pieces
- **Boundary checking** - moves must stay on board
- **Path validation** - pieces follow their movement patterns

### Display System
- **Case-sensitive notation** - White pieces in UPPERCASE, black in lowercase
- **Universal compatibility** - Works on any terminal/console
- **Clear piece identification** - Easy to distinguish piece types and colors
- **Standard chess notation** - Familiar to chess players worldwide

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] **Advanced endgame detection** (checkmate/stalemate)
- [ ] **Special moves** (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
- [ ] **Move history** and game replay
- [ ] **AI opponent** with difficulty levels
- [ ] **Save/load games** functionality
- [ ] **GUI interface** option
