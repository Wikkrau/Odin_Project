# Odin Project â€” Ruby Tictaktoe

Welcome to my version of Tictaktoe, built as part of the Odin Project

---
##  How to Play
Tic-tac-toe is a game played on a 3x3 grid where two players, one with "X" and the other with "O", take turns marking spaces. 
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. 
If all spaces are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
